-   The data structure you plan to use.
  - I will use arrays and objects to build the tic-tac-toe board, as well as
  - keep track of games played by users.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  - I will write out abstractions and use pseudocode, followed by creating the
  - real code step by step.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
  - I will try to plan out the steps and make necessary progress each day, while
  - also adhering to time-boxing principles. I will seek out help when needed.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
  - As a user, I want to be able to play tic-tac-toe on the web against friends
  - as well as strangers.
  - As a user, I want to be able to track my win/loss/tie record for ttt.
  - As a user, I want the game to be spiffy to keep me engaged.
  - As a user, I want to be able to log into my account and track my progress
  - over time.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
  - I will split the problem up into small chunks that work together. After
  - having working code, I will try to clean it up if possible to simplify.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  - ttt roulette would be fun, themes, or avatars.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  - commit early and often.
